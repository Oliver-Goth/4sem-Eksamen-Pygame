Overview
    This project uses the pygame library to simulate
    dice roll in python.

How it works
    The program presents the user with two option for rolling
    the dice.

    Option 1
        User can select a dice value from 1 to 6 by simply 
        pressing the appropriate number on the keyboard

    Option 2
        Users can also generate a random dice value by pressing the 'R'
        or 'r' key on the keyboard.

    Both options will generate a number which will then be displayed in 
    the pygame window with the appropriate number of dots just like the real
    die.
